# Repository-1
First repository as I learn about Data Science

I am getting a PhD in Biochemistry with a couple of years to go still. In my own time, I am learning basic computer science, expanding my technical skills with Python and R, learning how to properly do statistics on data, and thinking about how to apply these in a data science context.

I intend to do fundamental financial analysis. That's my intial project idea. I feel it may be a worthwhile learning experience both in developing data science and programming skills as well as learning about good investing. Both will be important life skills long-term for the rest of my life.

Ideally, as I'm getting a life sciences doctorate, I think I would like to look into data science in this field, possibly related to clinical trials and therapeutic development.
